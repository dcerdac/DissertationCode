There is being an increased environmental concern on the impact that energy consumption has over the planet. Buildings with better energy conversation properties could reduce this consumption and help increasing living quality. Heating Load (HL) and Cooling load (CL) have become a significant estimator used during the design stage of any new building. In this project we are proposing three Machine Learning classifiers that can improve on the design by reducing the time that is required to estimate building parameters. Classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Machine classifiers were used to predict the HL and CL from 768 building simulations. Finally, it was proved that Machine Learning approaches can have accurate predictions in the context of energy efficiency of buildings.
